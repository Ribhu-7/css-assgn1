    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
        </li>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen , paper , or in other media.</li>
        <li><strike>Css is not necessary</strike> <font class="item1">CSS saves a lot of work.</font>  It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
        <li><font class="item2">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</font>  </li>
    </ol>

     <h2>
         CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:
     </h2>

     <ul>
         <li class="item3">Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
         <li class="item3">Internal - by using a style element in the head section </li>
         <li class="item3">External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file</li>
         <li class="item3">The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <font class="item1">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</font> because this is easier to demonstate, and easier for you to try it yourself. </li>

     </ul>

    <p>When comparing CSS Vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements, ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
    
    <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once aan element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to this element.</p>

    <p>There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
